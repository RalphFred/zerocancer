# Waitlist Matching Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

The ZeroCancer Waitlist Matching Algorithm is an enhanced system designed to efficiently match patients on waitlists with available donation campaigns for medical screenings. This algorithm has been optimized for performance, accuracy, and comprehensive tracking.

## Business Logic & Core Features

### üè• **Core Matching Rules**

1. **Patient Eligibility Requirements**

   - Patient must have **fewer than 3 unclaimed allocations** (business limit)
   - Patient cannot have existing **MATCHED** allocation for the same screening type
   - Patient must be in **PENDING** status on the waitlist
   - Patient must meet campaign targeting criteria (if targeting enabled)

2. **First-Come-First-Served (FCFS) Processing**

   - Patients processed in order of waitlist **`joinedAt`** timestamp
   - Earlier joiners get priority for limited campaign funds
   - Batch processing respects FCFS within each screening type

3. **Campaign Selection Hierarchy**

   - **Targeted Campaigns** (highest priority)
     - Campaigns with demographic/geographic targeting that matches patient
     - More specific campaigns (fewer screening types) prioritized over general ones
     - Higher available amounts preferred over lower amounts
     - Older campaigns (earlier `createdAt`) get priority when tied
   - **General Pool Campaign** (fallback)
     - Used when no targeted campaigns match or qualify
     - Must have sufficient funds (`availableAmount >= agreedPrice`)
     - Campaign ID: `"general-donor-pool"`

4. **Fund Management**
   - Campaign **`availableAmount`** decremented by screening **`agreedPrice`**
   - Campaign **`reservedAmount`** incremented (optional field)
   - Allocation created with **`amountAllocated`** = screening agreed price
   - No partial funding - full screening cost must be available

### üéØ **Advanced Targeting System**

1. **Demographic Targeting**

   - **Age Range**: `targetAgeMin` and `targetAgeMax` with patient age calculation
   - **Gender Matching**: Multiple target genders supported (`targetGender[]`)
   - **Income Brackets**: `targetIncomeMin` and `targetIncomeMax` filtering

2. **Geographic Targeting**

   - **State-Level**: `targetStates[]` array matching patient state
   - **LGA-Level**: `targetLgas[]` array for Local Government Area targeting
   - **Priority**: LGA matches score higher than state-only matches

3. **Targeting Score Algorithm**
   ```
   Score Calculation:
   - Age Match: +10 points
   - Gender Match: +15 points
   - State Match: +20 points
   - LGA Match: +25 points (most specific)
   - Income Match: +10 points
   Maximum Score: 80 points
   ```

### üìã **Workflow & Status Management**

1. **Waitlist Status Transitions**

   ```
   PENDING ‚Üí MATCHED ‚Üí (Patient Claims) ‚Üí CLAIMED
                   ‚Üí (Auto-Expires) ‚Üí EXPIRED ‚Üí (Can Rejoin) ‚Üí PENDING
   ```

2. **Allocation Lifecycle**

   - Created with **`claimedAt: null`** (unclaimed state)
   - Patient claims allocation to book appointment
   - **Automatic expiry**: Unclaimed MATCHED allocations expire after configured days
   - **Fund return**: Expired allocations return funds to original campaigns
   - **Status transition**: MATCHED ‚Üí EXPIRED ‚Üí (patient can rejoin waitlist)
   - Unclaimed allocations count toward 3-allocation limit (EXPIRED don't count)
   - Expiry notifications sent to patients via email and in-app

3. **Campaign Status Requirements**
   - Only **ACTIVE** campaigns participate in matching
   - Campaigns with **`availableAmount > 0`** are eligible
   - Inactive or depleted campaigns automatically excluded

### üîÑ **Processing & Performance Features**

1. **Batch Processing Strategy**

   - Configurable batch sizes per screening type (`patientsPerScreeningType`)
   - Maximum total patients per execution (`maxTotalPatients`)
   - Smart patient filtering to respect business rules

2. **Database Optimization**

   - **Single Query Approach**: One comprehensive query fetches all required data
   - **Batch Transactions**: Multiple operations grouped into atomic transactions
   - **Efficient Joins**: Patient profiles, allocations, and campaigns loaded together

3. **Parallel Processing (Optional)**
   - Multiple screening types processed concurrently
   - Configurable concurrency limit (`maxConcurrentScreeningTypes`)
   - Database-safe with transaction isolation

### üîî **Notification & Communication**

1. **Patient Notifications**

   - **Type**: `MATCHED` notification type
   - **Channels**: In-app notification + optional email
   - **Content**: Screening details, campaign info, next steps
   - **Data**: Screening type ID, campaign ID, execution reference

2. **Donor Notifications**
   - **Type**: `PATIENT_MATCHED` notification type
   - **Channels**: In-app notification + email
   - **Content**: Patient matched to their campaign
   - **Data**: Patient anonymized info, screening type, allocation details

### üìä **Tracking & Audit Features**

1. **Execution-Level Tracking**

   - Unique execution reference for each algorithm run
   - Start/end timestamps and total processing time
   - Global metrics: patients processed, matches created, funds allocated
   - Configuration snapshot for reproducibility

2. **Screening Type Analytics**

   - Per-screening-type success rates and processing times
   - Campaign utilization patterns and effectiveness
   - Patient demographic distributions and targeting success

3. **Detailed Operation Logs**

   - Every significant operation logged with context

### ‚è∞ **Allocation Expiry System**

1. **Automatic Expiry Process**

   - Runs at the start of each algorithm execution
   - Finds MATCHED waitlists older than `allocationExpiryDays`
   - Transitions waitlist status from MATCHED to EXPIRED
   - Returns allocated funds to original campaigns
   - Sends expiry notifications to affected patients

2. **Expiry Business Rules**

   - **Expiry Threshold**: Based on waitlist `joinedAt` date + `allocationExpiryDays`
   - **Fund Recovery**: Full allocation amount returned to campaign `availableAmount`
   - **Patient Limits**: EXPIRED allocations don't count toward 3-allocation limit
   - **Rejoin Capability**: Patients can rejoin waitlist after expiry
   - **Notification**: Email and in-app notifications sent to patients

3. **Expiry Tracking & Metrics**
   - Number of allocations expired per execution
   - Total funds returned to campaigns
   - Expiry error tracking and logging
   - Per-execution expiry performance metrics
