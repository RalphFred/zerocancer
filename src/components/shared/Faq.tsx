              Yes â€” if you qualify for a sponsored screening or refer 10 people
              using your link, you can get screened at no cost. You can also
              choose to pay directly if you prefer.

              Eligibility for sponsored screening is based on various factors,
              including age, family history, and risk factors. You can complete our
              online assessment to see if you qualify.
