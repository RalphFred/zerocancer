Welcome to your new TanStack app!

# Running the Project

This monorepo uses pnpm workspaces. All commands should be run from the root directory unless otherwise specified.

## 1. Install dependencies for all packages

```bash
pnpm install
```

## 2. Start the frontend (Vite + React)

```bash
cd apps/frontend
pnpm dev
```

- The frontend will be available at http://localhost:5173 (or the port Vite chooses).

## 3. Start the backend (Hono.js + Prisma)

```bash
cd apps/backend
pnpm dev
```

- The backend will be available at http://localhost:3000 (or your configured port).

## 4. Shared Types/Utils

- Shared code lives in `packages/shared` and is imported using the `@shared` alias in both frontend and backend.

## 5. Notes

- Only the root `node_modules` is needed; do not run `pnpm install` in subfolders.
- You can run scripts for all packages from the root using `pnpm -r <script>` (e.g., `pnpm -r build`).

# ZeroCancer Monorepo

A fullstack monorepo using Vite + React + TanStack Router (frontend), Hono.js + Prisma (backend), and shared TypeScript types and Zod schemas.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies for all packages:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. **Run the frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```
3. **Run the backend:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pnpm dev
   ```

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
# Clone and enter the project directory
# git clone <repo-url>
cd zero-cancer/zerocancer
```

### 2. Install dependencies (root only)

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 3. Environment setup

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in `apps/backend` and `apps/frontend` if needed, and fill in required values (e.g., database URL for backend).

### 4. Database setup (backend)

```bash
pnpm --filter ./apps/backend prisma:generate
pnpm --filter ./apps/backend db:push
```

### 5. Start the development servers (auto builds shared code!)

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you use the `<Outlet />` component.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { Outlet, createRootRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";
import { TanStackRouterDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-router-devtools";

import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <header>
        <nav>
          <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          <Link to="/about">About</Link>
        </nav>
      </header>
      <Outlet />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

The `<TanStackRouterDevtools />` component is not required so you can remove it if you don't want it in your layout.

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
const peopleRoute = createRoute({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: "/people",
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people");
    return response.json() as Promise<{
      results: {
        name: string;
      }[];
    }>;
  },
  component: () => {
    const data = peopleRoute.useLoaderData();
    return (
      <ul>
        {data.results.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  },
});
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

### React-Query

React-Query is an excellent addition or alternative to route loading and integrating it into you application is a breeze.

First add your dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @tanstack/react-query @tanstack/react-query-devtools
```

Next we'll need to create a query client and provider. We recommend putting those in `main.tsx`.

```tsx
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";

// ...

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

// ...

if (!rootElement.innerHTML) {
  const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(rootElement);

  root.render(
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <RouterProvider router={router} />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  );
}
```

You can also add TanStack Query Devtools to the root route (optional).

```tsx
import { ReactQueryDevtools } from "@tanstack/react-query-devtools";

const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: () => (
    <>
      <Outlet />
      <ReactQueryDevtools buttonPosition="top-right" />
      <TanStackRouterDevtools />
    </>
  ),
});
```

Now you can use `useQuery` to fetch your data.

```tsx
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

import "./App.css";

function App() {
  const { data } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["people"],
    queryFn: () =>
      fetch("https://swapi.dev/api/people")
        .then((res) => res.json())
        .then((data) => data.results as { name: string }[]),
    initialData: [],
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {data.map((person) => (
          <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

You can find out everything you need to know on how to use React-Query in the [React-Query documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/overview).
